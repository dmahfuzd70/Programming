### Implementing PUT method in ASP.NET Web API 


In this video we will discuss implementing PUT method in ASP.NET Web API. PUT allows us to update an item.



Understanding Put method implementation is very easy if you have understood Post and Delete methods that we have discussed in Parts 7 and 8.

We want to update employee by Id. Include the following Put() method in EmployeesController. Notice the id of the employee that we want to update and the Employee object with which we want to update are being passed as parameters to the Post method. The Employee parameter is decorated with [FromBody] attribute. This tells Web API to get employee data from the request body.
